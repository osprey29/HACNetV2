HACNet V2: Rethinking the Full-Resolution  Network for Pixel-level Crack Detection
[paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2025.128144)

Welcome to the official repository for HACNet V2, an advanced deep learning architecture designed for precise pixel-level crack detection. 

HACNetV2 is an enhanced full-resolution architecture that builds upon our previous HACNet. Through key architectural refinements and novel components, HACNetV2 achieves substantially improved efficiency and effectiveness compared to its predecessor. 

## üîç What distinguishes HACNetv2 from existing crack detection models?

### üöÄ Simplicity
A straightforward architecture composed of six identical HybridASPA blocks, each maintaining consistent structure, parameters, input/output channel dimensions, and resolution. 

### üéØ Effectiveness
Superior detection accuracy, particularly in identifying tiny and fine-grained cracks.

### ‚ö° Efficiency
With only **0.52M parameters**, achieves real-time inference performance in **Jetson Orin AGX**.
